    <h2>The 2022 Summer Program - Industrial Software Development</h2>
    <h3></h3>
    <p>YCCS stands for Yeshiva College Computer Science and is one of the up and coming departments at <a href="https://www.yu.edu/">Yeshiva University</a>.
    Seeing continued growth over the past few years, the program hopes to continue improving.
    I am a student currently in YCCS and I truly feel that YCCS is doing a great job preparing us for the workfield.
    The assignments are challenging, the lectures are informative, and it is easy to see that the professors are there to help each and every student succeed.
    I am looking forward to the next few years of YCCS!</p>
    <p>A few programming languages that are taught at YCCS are</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Java</li>
      <li>Python</li>
      <li>C++</li>
    </ul>
    <p>And this is just a small amount of what is taught.</p>
